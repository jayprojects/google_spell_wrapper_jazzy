google_spell_wrapper_jazzy
==========================

A wrapper (Server application) to make Jazzy Spellchecker to mimic google spellcheck interface.


Google has shutdown their spell check service. Oh no! (sky falling emo!)
Well its rally not sky falling event science most of the modern browser already has its biltin spellcheck functionality. But if you sitll want to continue your spell check functionility for poor IE users and you had used google spellcheck then it might not be an easy task to switch all the pages to a new spellchecker.

so here is a resque option for you.

you can deploy this to your server then simply change to google url to your url 
for example 
From 
https://www.google.com/tbproxy/spell?lang=
to say
https://yoursite.com/google_spell_wrapper_jazzy/spellcheck.jsp?lang=
